# admin-dashboard

This is my attempt at the Admin Dashboard project from The Odin Project:

GH Pages link:

This was another fun project where I stuck with basic HTML and CSS for quickest deployment. Feeling pretty good about when to use Flexbox vs Grid, and have a solid grasp of how each function differently. This is the last part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project, and it has done a great job supplementing knowledge that I previously did not have, especially with regard to CSS grid and when to use it.
